## Import Path Fixes

We fixed several issues with import paths that were using the `@/` alias pattern that wasn't correctly configured in the application. Here's a summary of the changes made:

### Context Imports

- Fixed imports from `@/context` to use proper relative paths
- Example: `import { useUser } from '@/context'` → `import { useUser } from '../context/UserContext'`
- Files affected:
  - src/components/UniversalNavbar.js
  - src/components/UserSidebar.js
  - src/components/ThemeToggle.js
  - src/components/StepPreview.js
  - src/pages/Profile.jsx
  - src/pages/PostRoomPage.js

### Utility Imports

- Fixed imports from `@/utils` to use proper relative paths
- Example: `import { TiltCard, cardHover } from '@/utils'` → `import { TiltCard, cardHover } from './utils/animations'`
- Files affected:
  - src/RoomCard.js
  - src/FeaturedProperties.js
  - src/pages/Profile.jsx

### Other Fixes

- Fixed incorrect import of `initScrollAnimations` in index.js
- Removed duplicate import statements in multiple files
- Application now compiles and runs successfully

## Project Structure Improvements

The codebase now follows a more organized structure:

```
src/
  ├── components/           # Reusable UI components
  │   ├── cards/           # Card components (RoomCard, PropertyCard)
  │   ├── forms/           # Form components and form-related UI
  │   └── ui/              # Basic UI elements
  │       ├── buttons/
  │       ├── inputs/
  │       ├── layout/
  │       └── navigation/
  ├── pages/               # Page components
  ├── layouts/             # Layout components
  ├── hooks/               # Custom React hooks
  ├── context/             # React context providers
  ├── utils/               # Utility functions
  └── assets/              # Static assets
```

## Future Recommendations

1. **Testing**: Add unit and integration tests for key components
2. **Documentation**: Add more comprehensive documentation for components
3. **Styling**: Consider standardizing on a single CSS approach (CSS modules, styled components, etc.)
4. **State Management**: Evaluate if a more robust state management solution is needed
5. **Code Splitting**: Implement code splitting for better performance

## Next Steps

1. Verify that all functionality works as expected after reorganization
2. Run a complete test cycle to ensure no regressions
3. Consider implementing the future recommendations above
