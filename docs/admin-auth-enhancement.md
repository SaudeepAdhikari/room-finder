# Admin Authentication Enhancement

## Overview

This update enhances the admin authentication system by implementing a dedicated authentication context and improving error handling. The changes address the "Failed to fetch users" error by ensuring proper authentication flow and session handling.

## Key Changes

### 1. New Admin Auth Context

Created a dedicated `AdminAuthContext.js` that provides:

- Centralized authentication state management
- Automatic session verification on app load
- Improved error handling
- Consistent API for login/logout operations

### 2. Authentication Flow Updates

- Updated the login flow to use axios consistently
- Enhanced session handling with proper credentials
- Added authentication state checking before data fetching
- Implemented backward compatibility with the existing UserContext

### 3. Debugging Tools

- Added `AdminAuthDebug.js` component for real-time auth debugging
- Created `test-admin-auth.js` script to verify the authentication flow
- Added a debug server restart script (`restart_debug_server.bat`)

### 4. API Enhancements

- Standardized API calls with axios
- Improved error handling in API functions
- Added consistent credentials handling

## Testing Instructions

1. Run the enhanced debug server:

   ```
   restart_debug_server.bat
   ```

2. Test the authentication flow:

   ```
   cd backend
   node test-admin-auth.js
   ```

3. Access the admin panel at `/admin` to verify the login process

4. Check the authentication debug panel in Admin Settings

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. Check browser console for detailed error messages
2. Verify session handling in backend logs
3. Use the Auth Debug component in Admin Settings
4. Clear browser cookies and try logging in again

## Technical Implementation

The solution implements a React Context API pattern with:

- Authentication state management
- Session persistence
- Automatic session verification
- Protected route handling
- Consistent API interface

This enhancement addresses the root cause of the "Failed to fetch users" error by ensuring proper authentication state before making API calls.
